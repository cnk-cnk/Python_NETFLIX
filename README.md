# Python_NETFLIX
This data set include information on movies and tv-shows added on netflix from 2008 to 2021, downloaded from Kaggle.
# Analysis objective on a NETFLIX Dataset from Kaggle
- Netflix got more movies or TV shows  
- Number of films and television programs added to the platform yearly
- What is the annual average number of movies and tv shows added to the platform  
- How long it takes for a movie or tv-show to be added to NETFLIX after its relaese date 
- Time interval difference distribution between date added on NETFLIX and release date of Movies and TV shows  
- Movies and TV Shows duration distribution 
- Movies and TV Shows Ratings
- Locations where movies and tv shows were produced
# Data Analysis process
- I started by importing the data to my jupyter notebook
- Exploration of the different columns, records of dataframe
- Data cleaning and reshaping my data based on the analsyis objective
- Answering the business task listed above
# Findings
- Visually we observe that we have more Movies than TV shows added on NETFLIX
Well, we can't give a conclusion because we are doing exploratory analysis
In order to confidently answer this question we have to do some statistical test like
hypothesis testing....

- We have a lot of variations throughout the years. We first have very few and constant
addings from [2008 - 2014] for Movies, a sudden rise from [2014 - 2018] then a fall from
[2018 - 2021]
For TV shows, we have addings in 2008, then no addings up to 2013. From 2013 we
experience a rise and a fall from 2019
More to that we have 10 records of TV-shows, where we don't have a date added value

- On average (yearly) we have 267 TV shows and 438 Movies added on NETFLIX from our
sample data (dataset)
From the adding trend above, there is alot of variation throughout the years, the yearly
average varies a lot, we can't give a firm conclusion, that each year we will fairly expect
the above calculated average values.
